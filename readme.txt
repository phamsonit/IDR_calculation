## This Jupyter notebook provides sample data and code to calculate the Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) index using an organizational approach, as described in the paper titled "Identifying Interdisciplinary Research in Research Projects." 


## Identifying interdisciplinary research has become an important area of study in scientometrics. However, defining what exactly constitutes interdisciplinarity and how it manifests in research activities, such as publications or research projects, remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a mathematical modeling approach to interdisciplinarity measurement based on assessing project diversity. Particularly, we propose a novel approach that combines three indicators: the diversity of researchers, the diversity of research organizations, and the diversity of research disciplines involved in the project, to identify potentially interdisciplinary research projects. To measure diversity, we employ various methods, including distance matrix calculation, evaluation of the distance between researchers, and assessment of the relevancy of researchers' expertise to the projects.


## The provided codes, in this repository, aim to demonstrate how to calculate wasserstein distance between two vectors, diversity, relevancy weight. To apply the codes to real datasets, users need to extract data, calculate discipline vectors and distance matrix as show in the example data.
